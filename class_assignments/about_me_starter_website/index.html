				<h2>About Aniruddha</h2>
				<p>
					Aniruddha likes to talk design - right from service design to icon design. He advocates Jesse James Garrett and Don Norman and tries to get the works of Edward Tufte in his visualizations. He swears by Gestalt's principles, and makes it a point to talk about every non design person about them.
				</p>
				<p>
				If he wasn't designing great user experiences, he'd love to be a Street Photographer, just like the likes of Henri Carter Bresson. He loves to shoot in black and white, and focus on the form, and the composition (along with the emotion) before pressing the trigger.
